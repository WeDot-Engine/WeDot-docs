# HTTPClient

**继承：** [`RefCounted`](class_refcounted.md) **<** [`Object`](class_object.md)

Low-level hyper-text transfer protocol client.

## 描述

Hyper-text transfer protocol client (sometimes called "User Agent"). Used to make HTTP requests to download web content, upload files and other data or to communicate with various services, among other use cases.

See the [`HTTPRequest`](class_httprequest.md) node for a higher-level alternative.

 **Note:** This client only needs to connect to a host once (see [`connect_to_host`](#class_httpclient_method_connect_to_host)) to send multiple requests. Because of this, methods that take URLs usually take just the part after the host instead of the full URL, as the client is already connected to a host. See [`request`](#class_httpclient_method_request) for a full example and to get started.

A **HTTPClient** should be reused between multiple requests or to connect to different hosts instead of creating one client per request. Supports Transport Layer Security (TLS), including server certificate verification. HTTP status codes in the 2xx range indicate success, 3xx redirection (i.e. "try again, but over here"), 4xx something was wrong with the request, and 5xx something went wrong on the server's side.

For more information on HTTP, see [*MDN's documentation on HTTP*](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP) (or read [*RFC 2616*](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2616) to get it straight from the source).

 **Note:** When exporting to Android, make sure to enable the `INTERNET` permission in the Android export preset before exporting the project or using one-click deploy. Otherwise, network communication of any kind will be blocked by Android.

 **Note:** It's recommended to use transport encryption (TLS) and to avoid sending sensitive information (such as login credentials) in HTTP GET URL parameters. Consider using HTTP POST requests or HTTP headers for such information instead.

 **Note:** When performing HTTP requests from a project exported to Web, keep in mind the remote server may not allow requests from foreign origins due to [*CORS*](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS). If you host the server in question, you should modify its backend to allow requests from foreign origins by adding the `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *` HTTP header.

 **Note:** TLS support is currently limited to TLS 1.0, TLS 1.1, and TLS 1.2. Attempting to connect to a TLS 1.3-only server will return an error.

 **Warning:** TLS certificate revocation and certificate pinning are currently not supported. Revoked certificates are accepted as long as they are otherwise valid. If this is a concern, you may want to use automatically managed certificates with a short validity period.

<div id="_class_httpclient_constant_response_switching_protocols"></div>

[ResponseCode](#enum_httpclient_responsecode) **RESPONSE_SWITCHING_PROTOCOLS** = ``101``

HTTP status code `101 Switching Protocol`. Sent in response to an `Upgrade` request header by the client. Indicates the protocol the server is switching to.

<div id="_class_httpclient_constant_response_processing"></div>

[ResponseCode](#enum_httpclient_responsecode) **RESPONSE_PROCESSING** = ``102``

<div id="_class_httpclient_constant_response_ok"></div>

[ResponseCode](#enum_httpclient_responsecode) **RESPONSE_OK** = ``200``

HTTP status code `200 OK`. The request has succeeded. Default response for successful requests. Meaning varies depending on the request. GET: The resource has been fetched and is transmitted in the message body. HEAD: The entity headers are in the message body. POST: The resource describing the result of the action is transmitted in the message body. TRACE: The message body contains the request message as received by the server.

<div id="_class_httpclient_constant_response_created"></div>

[ResponseCode](#enum_httpclient_responsecode) **RESPONSE_CREATED** = ``201``

HTTP status code `201 Created`. The request has succeeded and a new resource has been created as a result of it. This is typically the response sent after a PUT request.

<div id="_class_httpclient_constant_response_accepted"></div>

[ResponseCode](#enum_httpclient_responsecode) **RESPONSE_ACCEPTED** = ``202``

HTTP status code `202 Accepted`. The request has been received but not yet acted upon. It is non-committal, meaning that there is no way in HTTP to later send an asynchronous response indicating the outcome of processing the request. It is intended for cases where another process or server handles the request, or for batch processing.

<div id="_class_httpclient_constant_response_non_authoritative_information"></div>

[ResponseCode](#enum_httpclient_responsecode) **RESPONSE_NON_AUTHORITATIVE_INFORMATION** = ``203``

HTTP status code `203 Non-Authoritative Information`. This response code means returned meta-information set is not exact set as available from the origin server, but collected from a local or a third party copy. Except this condition, 200 OK response should be preferred instead of this response.

<div id="_class_httpclient_constant_response_no_content"></div>

[ResponseCode](#enum_httpclient_responsecode) **RESPONSE_NO_CONTENT** = ``204``

HTTP status code `204 No Content`. There is no content to send for this request, but the headers may be useful. The user-agent may update its cached headers for this resource with the new ones.

<div id="_class_httpclient_constant_response_reset_content"></div>

[ResponseCode](#enum_httpclient_responsecode) **RESPONSE_RESET_CONTENT** = ``205``

HTTP status code `205 Reset Content`. The server has fulfilled the request and desires that the client resets the "document view" that caused the request to be sent to its original state as received from the origin server.

<div id="_class_httpclient_constant_response_partial_content"></div>

[ResponseCode](#enum_httpclient_responsecode) **RESPONSE_PARTIAL_CONTENT** = ``206``

<div id="_class_httpclient_constant_response_multi_status"></div>

[ResponseCode](#enum_httpclient_responsecode) **RESPONSE_MULTI_STATUS** = ``207``

HTTP status code `207 Multi-Status` (WebDAV). A Multi-Status response conveys information about multiple resources in situations where multiple status codes might be appropriate.

<div id="_class_httpclient_constant_response_already_reported"></div>

[ResponseCode](#enum_httpclient_responsecode) **RESPONSE_ALREADY_REPORTED** = ``208``

HTTP status code `208 Already Reported` (WebDAV). Used inside a DAV: propstat response element to avoid enumerating the internal members of multiple bindings to the same collection repeatedly.

<div id="_class_httpclient_constant_response_im_used"></div>

[ResponseCode](#enum_httpclient_responsecode) **RESPONSE_IM_USED** = ``226``

HTTP status code `226 IM Used` (WebDAV). The server has fulfilled a GET request for the resource, and the response is a representation of the result of one or more instance-manipulations applied to the current instance.

<div id="_class_httpclient_constant_response_multiple_choices"></div>

[ResponseCode](#enum_httpclient_responsecode) **RESPONSE_MULTIPLE_CHOICES** = ``300``

HTTP status code `300 Multiple Choice`. The request has more than one possible responses and there is no standardized way to choose one of the responses. User-agent or user should choose one of them.

<div id="_class_httpclient_constant_response_moved_permanently"></div>

[ResponseCode](#enum_httpclient_responsecode) **RESPONSE_MOVED_PERMANENTLY** = ``301``

HTTP status code `301 Moved Permanently`. Redirection. This response code means the URI of requested resource has been changed. The new URI is usually included in the response.

<div id="_class_httpclient_constant_response_found"></div>

[ResponseCode](#enum_httpclient_responsecode) **RESPONSE_FOUND** = ``302``

HTTP status code `302 Found`. Temporary redirection. This response code means the URI of requested resource has been changed temporarily. New changes in the URI might be made in the future. Therefore, this same URI should be used by the client in future requests.

<div id="_class_httpclient_constant_response_see_other"></div>

[ResponseCode](#enum_httpclient_responsecode) **RESPONSE_SEE_OTHER** = ``303``

HTTP status code `303 See Other`. The server is redirecting the user agent to a different resource, as indicated by a URI in the Location header field, which is intended to provide an indirect response to the original request.

<div id="_class_httpclient_constant_response_not_modified"></div>

[ResponseCode](#enum_httpclient_responsecode) **RESPONSE_NOT_MODIFIED** = ``304``

HTTP status code `304 Not Modified`. A conditional GET or HEAD request has been received and would have resulted in a 200 OK response if it were not for the fact that the condition evaluated to `false`.

<div id="_class_httpclient_constant_response_use_proxy"></div>

[ResponseCode](#enum_httpclient_responsecode) **RESPONSE_USE_PROXY** = ``305``

**已弃用：** Many clients ignore this response code for security reasons. It is also deprecated by the HTTP standard.

HTTP status code `305 Use Proxy`.

<div id="_class_httpclient_constant_response_switch_proxy"></div>

[ResponseCode](#enum_httpclient_responsecode) **RESPONSE_SWITCH_PROXY** = ``306``

**已弃用：** Many clients ignore this response code for security reasons. It is also deprecated by the HTTP standard.

HTTP status code `306 Switch Proxy`.

<div id="_class_httpclient_constant_response_temporary_redirect"></div>

[ResponseCode](#enum_httpclient_responsecode) **RESPONSE_TEMPORARY_REDIRECT** = ``307``

HTTP status code `307 Temporary Redirect`. The target resource resides temporarily under a different URI and the user agent MUST NOT change the request method if it performs an automatic redirection to that URI.

<div id="_class_httpclient_constant_response_permanent_redirect"></div>

[ResponseCode](#enum_httpclient_responsecode) **RESPONSE_PERMANENT_REDIRECT** = ``308``

HTTP status code `308 Permanent Redirect`. The target resource has been assigned a new permanent URI and any future references to this resource ought to use one of the enclosed URIs.

<div id="_class_httpclient_constant_response_bad_request"></div>

[ResponseCode](#enum_httpclient_responsecode) **RESPONSE_BAD_REQUEST** = ``400``

HTTP status code `400 Bad Request`. The request was invalid. The server cannot or will not process the request due to something that is perceived to be a client error (e.g., malformed request syntax, invalid request message framing, invalid request contents, or deceptive request routing).

<div id="_class_httpclient_constant_response_unauthorized"></div>

[ResponseCode](#enum_httpclient_responsecode) **RESPONSE_UNAUTHORIZED** = ``401``

HTTP status code `401 Unauthorized`. Credentials required. The request has not been applied because it lacks valid authentication credentials for the target resource.

<div id="_class_httpclient_constant_response_payment_required"></div>

[ResponseCode](#enum_httpclient_responsecode) **RESPONSE_PAYMENT_REQUIRED** = ``402``

HTTP status code `402 Payment Required`. This response code is reserved for future use. Initial aim for creating this code was using it for digital payment systems, however this is not currently used.

[ResponseCode](#enum_httpclient_responsecode) **RESPONSE_FORBIDDEN** = ``403``

HTTP status code `403 Forbidden`. The client does not have access rights to the content, i.e. they are unauthorized, so server is rejecting to give proper response. Unlike `401`, the client's identity is known to the server.

<div id="_class_httpclient_constant_response_not_found"></div>

[ResponseCode](#enum_httpclient_responsecode) **RESPONSE_NOT_FOUND** = ``404``

HTTP status code `404 Not Found`. The server can not find requested resource. Either the URL is not recognized or the endpoint is valid but the resource itself does not exist. May also be sent instead of 403 to hide existence of a resource if the client is not authorized.

[ResponseCode](#enum_httpclient_responsecode) **RESPONSE_REQUEST_ENTITY_TOO_LARGE** = ``413``

HTTP status code `413 Entity Too Large`. The server is refusing to process a request because the request payload is larger than the server is willing or able to process.

<div id="_class_httpclient_constant_response_request_uri_too_long"></div>

[ResponseCode](#enum_httpclient_responsecode) **RESPONSE_REQUEST_URI_TOO_LONG** = ``414``

HTTP status code `414 Request-URI Too Long`. The server is refusing to service the request because the request-target is longer than the server is willing to interpret.

<div id="_class_httpclient_constant_response_unsupported_media_type"></div>

[ResponseCode](#enum_httpclient_responsecode) **RESPONSE_UNSUPPORTED_MEDIA_TYPE** = ``415``

HTTP status code `415 Unsupported Media Type`. The origin server is refusing to service the request because the payload is in a format not supported by this method on the target resource.

<div id="_class_httpclient_constant_response_requested_range_not_satisfiable"></div>

[ResponseCode](#enum_httpclient_responsecode) **RESPONSE_REQUESTED_RANGE_NOT_SATISFIABLE** = ``416``

HTTP status code `416 Requested Range Not Satisfiable`. None of the ranges in the request's Range header field overlap the current extent of the selected resource or the set of ranges requested has been rejected due to invalid ranges or an excessive request of small or overlapping ranges.

<div id="_class_httpclient_constant_response_expectation_failed"></div>

[ResponseCode](#enum_httpclient_responsecode) **RESPONSE_EXPECTATION_FAILED** = ``417``

HTTP status code `417 Expectation Failed`. The expectation given in the request's Expect header field could not be met by at least one of the inbound servers.

[ResponseCode](#enum_httpclient_responsecode) **RESPONSE_MISDIRECTED_REQUEST** = ``421``

HTTP status code `421 Misdirected Request`. The request was directed at a server that is not able to produce a response. This can be sent by a server that is not configured to produce responses for the combination of scheme and authority that are included in the request URI.

<div id="_class_httpclient_constant_response_unprocessable_entity"></div>

[ResponseCode](#enum_httpclient_responsecode) **RESPONSE_UNPROCESSABLE_ENTITY** = ``422``

HTTP status code `422 Unprocessable Entity` (WebDAV). The server understands the content type of the request entity (hence a 415 Unsupported Media Type status code is inappropriate), and the syntax of the request entity is correct (thus a 400 Bad Request status code is inappropriate) but was unable to process the contained instructions.

<div id="_class_httpclient_constant_response_locked"></div>

[ResponseCode](#enum_httpclient_responsecode) **RESPONSE_LOCKED** = ``423``

HTTP status code `423 Locked` (WebDAV). The source or destination resource of a method is locked.

<div id="_class_httpclient_constant_response_upgrade_required"></div>

[ResponseCode](#enum_httpclient_responsecode) **RESPONSE_UPGRADE_REQUIRED** = ``426``

HTTP status code `426 Upgrade Required`. The server refuses to perform the request using the current protocol but might be willing to do so after the client upgrades to a different protocol.

<div id="_class_httpclient_constant_response_precondition_required"></div>

[ResponseCode](#enum_httpclient_responsecode) **RESPONSE_PRECONDITION_REQUIRED** = ``428``

HTTP status code `428 Precondition Required`. The origin server requires the request to be conditional.

<div id="_class_httpclient_constant_response_too_many_requests"></div>

[ResponseCode](#enum_httpclient_responsecode) **RESPONSE_TOO_MANY_REQUESTS** = ``429``

HTTP status code `429 Too Many Requests`. The user has sent too many requests in a given amount of time (see "rate limiting"). Back off and increase time between requests or try again later.

<div id="_class_httpclient_constant_response_request_header_fields_too_large"></div>

[ResponseCode](#enum_httpclient_responsecode) **RESPONSE_REQUEST_HEADER_FIELDS_TOO_LARGE** = ``431``

HTTP status code `431 Request Header Fields Too Large`. The server is unwilling to process the request because its header fields are too large. The request MAY be resubmitted after reducing the size of the request header fields.

<div id="_class_httpclient_constant_response_unavailable_for_legal_reasons"></div>

[ResponseCode](#enum_httpclient_responsecode) **RESPONSE_UNAVAILABLE_FOR_LEGAL_REASONS** = ``451``

HTTP status code `451 Response Unavailable For Legal Reasons`. The server is denying access to the resource as a consequence of a legal demand.

<div id="_class_httpclient_constant_response_bad_gateway"></div>

[ResponseCode](#enum_httpclient_responsecode) **RESPONSE_BAD_GATEWAY** = ``502``

HTTP status code `502 Bad Gateway`. The server, while acting as a gateway or proxy, received an invalid response from an inbound server it accessed while attempting to fulfill the request. Usually returned by load balancers or proxies.

<div id="_class_httpclient_constant_response_service_unavailable"></div>

[ResponseCode](#enum_httpclient_responsecode) **RESPONSE_SERVICE_UNAVAILABLE** = ``503``

HTTP status code `503 Service Unavailable`. The server is currently unable to handle the request due to a temporary overload or scheduled maintenance, which will likely be alleviated after some delay. Try again later.

<div id="_class_httpclient_constant_response_gateway_timeout"></div>

[ResponseCode](#enum_httpclient_responsecode) **RESPONSE_GATEWAY_TIMEOUT** = ``504``

HTTP status code `504 Gateway Timeout`. The server, while acting as a gateway or proxy, did not receive a timely response from an upstream server it needed to access in order to complete the request. Usually returned by load balancers or proxies.

[ResponseCode](#enum_httpclient_responsecode) **RESPONSE_VARIANT_ALSO_NEGOTIATES** = ``506``

HTTP status code `506 Variant Also Negotiates`. The server has an internal configuration error: the chosen variant resource is configured to engage in transparent content negotiation itself, and is therefore not a proper end point in the negotiation process.

<div id="_class_httpclient_constant_response_insufficient_storage"></div>

[ResponseCode](#enum_httpclient_responsecode) **RESPONSE_INSUFFICIENT_STORAGE** = ``507``

HTTP status code `507 Insufficient Storage`. The method could not be performed on the resource because the server is unable to store the representation needed to successfully complete the request.

<div id="_class_httpclient_constant_response_loop_detected"></div>

[ResponseCode](#enum_httpclient_responsecode) **RESPONSE_LOOP_DETECTED** = ``508``

    // Returns "username=user&password=pass"
```



Furthermore, if a key has a `null` value, only the key itself is added, without equal sign and value. If the value is an array, for each value in it a pair with the same key is added.



```gdscript

    var fields = {"single": 123, "not_valued": null, "multiple": [22, 33, 44]}
    var query_string = http_client.query_string_from_dict(fields)
    # Returns "single=123&not_valued&multiple=22&multiple=33&multiple=44"
```

```csharp

    var fields = new Godot.Collections.Dictionary

<div id="_class_httpclient_method_request"></div>

[Error](#enum_@globalscope_error) **request** ( method: [Method](#enum_httpclient_method), url: [`String`](class_string.md), headers: [`PackedStringArray`](class_packedstringarray.md), body: [`String`](class_string.md) = "" )<div id="class_httpclient_method_request"></div>

Sends a request to the connected host.

The URL parameter is usually just the part after the host, so for `https://somehost.com/index.php`, it is `/index.php`. When sending requests to an HTTP proxy server, it should be an absolute URL. For [`METHOD_OPTIONS`](#class_httpclient_constant_method_options) requests, `*` is also allowed. For [`METHOD_CONNECT`](#class_httpclient_constant_method_connect) requests, it should be the authority component (`host:port`).

Headers are HTTP request headers. For available HTTP methods, see [Method](#enum_httpclient_method).

To create a POST request with query strings to push to the server, do:



```gdscript

    var fields = {"username" : "user", "password" : "pass"}
    var query_string = http_client.query_string_from_dict(fields)
    var headers = ["Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded", "Content-Length: " + str(query_string.length())]
    var result = http_client.request(http_client.METHOD_POST, "/index.php", headers, query_string)
```

```csharp

    var fields = new Godot.Collections.Dictionary { { "username", "user" }, { "password", "pass" } };
    string queryString = new HttpClient().QueryStringFromDict(fields);
    string[] headers = { "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded", $"Content-Length: {queryString.Length}" };
    var result = new HttpClient().Request(HttpClient.Method.Post, "index.php", headers, queryString);
```



 **Note:** The `body` parameter is ignored if `method` is [`METHOD_GET`](#class_httpclient_constant_method_get). This is because GET methods can't contain request data. As a workaround, you can pass request data as a query string in the URL. See [`String.uri_encode`](#class_string_method_uri_encode) for an example.

Sends a raw request to the connected host.

The URL parameter is usually just the part after the host, so for `https://somehost.com/index.php`, it is `/index.php`. When sending requests to an HTTP proxy server, it should be an absolute URL.
